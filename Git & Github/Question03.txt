- A .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files and folders to ingore.
- It is usually placed in the root directory of a project.
- When Git sees a .gitignore file, it will ignore any files or filder that are listed in the file.

- The .ignore files are important in version control because they help to keep the repository clean
and organized.
- They also prevent developers from accidentally committing unnecessary files to the repository,
such as logfiles, build artifacts and IDE configuration files.

- Some example: personal secret files,log files,IDE config files, temporary files.
