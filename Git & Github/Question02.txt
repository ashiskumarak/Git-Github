Git workflow is a set of steps and stages that developers follow to manage and track changes effectively using Git.

It involves three main components:
        => Working directory
        => Staging area
        => Repository

=> Working Directory:- The working directory is the local file system where you create, edit and organize your project files.
                       When you initiate a git repository in a directory, it becomes a part of the working directory.

=> Staging area:- It is the intermediate area between the working directory and the repository.
                  It acts as a holding area for changes you want to include in the next commit.
                  Before a file's changes are committed, they need to be stages in the index.

=> Repository:- The repository also known as the Git repository or Git database, is where Git permanately
                stores committed snapshorts of your project.
                It contains the complete history of changes, branches, tags,and other Git-related data.
