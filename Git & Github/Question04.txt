- GitHub is a cloud based hosting service that helps developers store and manage thier code
 as well as track and control changes to their code over time.

- It also provide a number of features that make it easy for teams to collaborate on software projects.

-GitHub facilitates collaboration and version control in the followin ways:-
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Version control:GitHub used Git, a distributed version control system to track changes to code.
                  This allows developers to see who made what changes and when and to revert previous version of the code if necessary.

-Branches and pull requests: GitHub makes it easy for developers to create and manage branches of their code.
                             This allow developers to work on new features or fix bugs without affecting the main codease.
                             Once a developer is ready to manage their changes back into the main codebase.
                             they can create a pull request.
                             This allows other developer to review the changes and provide feedback before they are merged.

- Issues and tasks: GitHub provides a way for developers to track issues and tasks realated to their code.
                    This helps teams to stay organised and to prioritize their work.

-Code reviews: GitHub makes it easy for developers to review each other's code.
                This helps to improve the quality of the code and to identify potential bugs.

- Discussions: Github provides a way for developers to discuss their code and ask questions.
               This helps to promote collaaboration and knowledge sharing.


-Some of the platforms that provide the same functionality similar to GitHub can be:
