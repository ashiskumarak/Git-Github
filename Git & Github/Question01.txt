
✔ Version control is a system that tracks changes to a set of files over time.

✔ It allows developer to see who made what changes and when, and to revert to previous version of the code if needed.

✔ Version control system is essential for software development because it allows teams to collaborate on same project without stepping on each other's toes.

It's importance in software development:
----------------------------------------
✔ Collaboration: Makes it easy for multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time.
                  Developers can create their own branches of the code to work on new features of fix bugs
                  and then merge their changes back into main codebase once they are complete.

✔ History: Keeps complete history of all changes to the code.
            This makes it easy to track down the source of a bug or to revert to a previous version of the code if necessary.

✔ Backup: Serves as a backup for the code. If a developer accidentally deletes a file or makes a mistak,
           they can easily restore the file or revert to a previous version of the code.

✔ Auditing: It can be used to audit changes to the code. 
             This can be helpful for tracking down security vulnerabilities or for complaying with regulations.
